# LinkedIn Data Scraping

![Swiss American Chamber of Commerce Logo](https://saccsf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/saccsf-logo.jpg)

This report contains code to extract data from LinkedIn HTML files and convert them into a JSON file. The code is programmed to extract data from company pages of the about section. The data can be extracted from individual persons via the person search. The advantage is that several HTML files can be stored in the designated person or company folder and the data is stored in a single JSON.
This code may violate LinkedIn's Code of Conduct and is executed at your own risk.
